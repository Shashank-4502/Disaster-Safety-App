# Disaster-Safety-App
This app uses an earthquake API to detect seismic waves, sending notifications if values exceed normal levels, prompting nearby safe places. It enables users to request assistance, report disasters with images and descriptions, and provides offline first aid info and Emergency steps. Govt can access requested needs and disaster data.
